          <h2>Mother of Indian Feminism</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Savitribai Phule </b>
            was an Indian social reformer, educator, and poet. She is regarded
            as one of the most influential figures in the women's rights
            movement in India. Savitribai Phule played a crucial role in
            advocating for women's education and fought against social
            discrimination prevalent in the 19th century. Savitribai Phule was
            born on January 3, 1831, in Naigaon, Maharashtra, India. She
            belonged to a low-caste family, and her early life was marked by
            poverty and social marginalization. Despite these challenges, she
            displayed a strong desire for education and an unwavering commitment
            to social reform. In 1848, Savitribai Phule, along with her husband
            Jyotirao Phule, established the first school for girls in Pune,
            Maharashtra. This institution was a significant milestone in the
            field of women's education in India, as it provided an opportunity
            for girls from marginalized communities to access education.
